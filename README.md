I wrote my code in Python (Version 3.7.0)
It it designed to be used in a terminal. I provided a bash script (install.sh) that installs all dependencies that aren't included in the python standard library.

The script is executed by the following command:
```
python create_license_pull_requests.py [organization] [username] [password]
```
